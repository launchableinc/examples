Hi there!

You can see this example repository to get a sense of how to integrate [Launchable](https://www.launchableinc.com).

Weâ€™ve created very basic applications and CI configurations.

If you have long running tests that you want to shrink or run earlier in your pipeline, you can sign up for a free Launchable trial at [app.launchableinc.com/signup](https://app.launchableinc.com/signup)!
